Getting Started

 This application include  a set of APIs to be built that provide capabilities to calculate discounts, 
 generate the total costs and generate the invoices for customers.
 
 It follows the rules listed below.
 
1. If the user is an employee of the store, he gets a 30% discount
2. If the user is an affiliate of the store, he gets a 10% discount
3. If the user has been a customer for over 2 years, he gets a 5% discount.
4. For every $100 on the bill, there would be a $ 5 discount (e.g. for $ 990, you get $ 45 as a discount).
5. The percentage based discounts do not apply on groceries.
6. A user can get only one of the percentage based discounts on a bill.
